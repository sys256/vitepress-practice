# vitepress-practice

**This repository is a [VitePress](https://vitepress.dev) sandbox environment created for learning and experimentation purposes only and may not conform to best practices or standards.**

## Overview

The main aim of this project is to explore the concept of _static website generation_ and improve my skills. Although some of the code may be useful, it may contain incomplete features, misinterpretations, bugs, or non-optimized code. Please keep in mind that the focus here is on learning rather than creating a polished product.
